Difference between Salesforce Files & Notes and Attachments

Files: Upload, store, find, follow, share, sync, and collaborate on Salesforce files in the cloud.
usage - Upload a file and store it privately until you're ready to share it. Share the file with coworkers and groups to collaborate and get feedback. Attach files to posts in a Chatter feed on the Home tab, Chatter tab, a profile, a record, or a group. Users with access to Salesforce Files Sync can access, sync, and share files in their Salesforce Files Sync folder.

Notes and Attachments: Add a file to a specific record, like an event, marketing campaign, contact, or case by attaching it on the Attachments related list.

Objects you create that map to data stored outside your organization are called external objects

Note Object: Represents a note, which is text associated with a custom object or a standard object, such as a Contact, Contract, or Opportunity. Use this object to manage notes for an object.

Attachment Object: Represents a file that a User has uploaded and attached to a parent object.

The API sends and receives the binary file attachment data encoded as a base64Binary data type. Prior to creating a record, client applications must encode the binary attachment data as base64. Upon receiving a response, client applications must decode the base64 data to binary

The create call restricts these files to a maximum size of 25 MB. For a file attached to a Solution, the limit is 1.5 MB. The maximum email attachment size is 3 MB.

Process Builder cannot access Attachment object. We cannot trigger a process builder when ever a attachment object is created or updated. Process Builder does not allow you to select Attachment as triggering object

Queues allow groups of users to manage a shared workload more effectively. A queue is a location where records can be routed to await processing by a group member. The records remain in the queue until a user accepts them for processing or they are transferred to another queue. You can specify the set of objects that are supported by each queue, as well as the set of users that are allowed to retrieve records from the queue.

Machine learning is the core driver of AI. It’s the process of using algorithms to tell you something interesting about your data without writing code specific to the problem you’re trying to solve
it’s a way to have computers learn from data with minimal programming. Instead of writing code, you feed a machine data and it builds its own logical function based on this data.

Deep Learning
Deep learning is great at automatically learning the best features from somewhat noisy data (read: unstructured) so that algorithms can learn more effectively

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) is a form of machine learning that recognizes language and its many usage and grammar rules by finding patterns within large data sets

insertAdjacentHTML() parses the specified text as HTML or XML and inserts the resulting nodes into the DOM tree at a specified position. It does not reparse the element it is being used on and thus it does not corrupt the existing elements inside that element. This avoids the extra step of serialization, making it much faster than direct innerHTML

Syntax: element.insertAdjacentHTML(position, text);
