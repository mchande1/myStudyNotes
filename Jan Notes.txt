An iterator traverses through every item in a collection. For example, in a while loop in Apex, you define a condition for exiting the loop, and you must provide some means of traversing the collection, that is, an iterator.
Count is the iterator in the below sample
while (count < 11) {
   System.debug(count);
      count++;
   }

Using the Iterator interface you can create a custom set of instructions for traversing a List through a loop

A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet.
in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is com

A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer computer files between a client and server on a computer network.

Privacy mode or "private browsing" or "incognito mode" is a privacy feature in some web browsers to disable browsing history and the web cache. This allows a person to browse the Web without storing local data that could be retrieved at a later date

autonomy: the right or condition of self-government.

In telecommunications, a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. These are the rules or standard that defines the syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, a protocol for sending e-mail messages between servers. Most e-mail systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another; the messages can then be retrieved with an e-mail client using either POP or IMAP. In addition, SMTP is generally used to send messages from a mail client to a mail server. This is why you need to specify both the POP or IMAP server and the SMTP server when you configure your e-mail application.

Post Office Protocol, a protocol used to retrieve e-mail from a mail server. Most e-mail applications (sometimes called an e-mail client) use the POP protocol, although some can use the newer IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol).

IMAP: a protocol for retrieving e-mail messages

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents.

Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.
Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.no
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

The definition of computer telephony integration (CTI) is a term that can be used to describe any technology that enables computers to interact with telephones. This technology is primarily used in call centers and is often used to describe desktop interactions that improve human agents' productivity.

Arjuna was just like the other students. What set him apart was his will power. Distractions are always going to be there in one form or the other. It takes will power to not get indulged. Determination and the strong will power is the key.
Combine the concentration with determination and will power. Be your own Arjuna!
Arjuna's reply is reflective of his abilities to streamline all his focus towards the goal. Concentration is what we learn from here.

Arjuna was able to ignore everything else and have his eyes only on the prize. In life, there are so many irrelevant things that consume our energy on a day-to-day basis. We should always put the chaos aside and concentrate on things that matter.

The truth is O Arjuna when you think of the pain and needs of others and work to help them, you are doing God's work and hence God Himself takes care of you

Perseverance and concentration help us not just with archery, as in the case of Arjuna, but in all the tasks we perform everyday. Whether it is a project or just homework, working diligently and with concentration, we can complete our work faster, and in a much better way!

As I want you all to know concentration is a great power in life; you could win anything with this power. Concentration is possible only through a healthy body and a healthy mind. When I say healthy mind, what I mean is a mind which is able to exercise perfect control over the senses and emotions- Then you need to develop faith in yourself; you must have confidence in yourself to be successful. This comes only through practice over and over again. Finally, you need faith in the Supreme Power that rules this universe and governs all our activities. That alone could invest you with an equanimous attitude towards life. All these factors go to make perfect concentration."

Concentration is a great power which is within the scope of everyone to develop. No matter what the goal the word Impossible does not exist for concentration. But the great tragedy is that in the case of many of us concentration is just in the rudimentary stage. Whatever little of it is acquired is handicapped by fear, worry and haste. It in only in rare cases that one sees the real scope of concentration. There is however nothing which prevents one from developing one's concentration, no mater how old one may be. To begin with, all that is needed is a genuine desire to get the best out of one's life, and that desire will guide one along the high road of concentration.

the best archer is the one who can only see his target and nothing else. Arjuna demonstrated his greatness simply by having the proper focus. Arjuna’s singular focus enabled him to achieve mastery of archery, as described throughout the Mahabharata.
The character of Arjuna is described as one whose mind is spotless and clean of all impurities. Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita refers to Arjuna as Anagha, which means pure of heart or sinless. Arjuna's nobility is manifested in his magnanimity in victory and compassion towards adversaries

5) Swiftness
As an archer, Arjun displayed swiftness and neat movements. Athough he excelled in this, he never underestimated his opponent, which made him a better person.

If the task is gigantic and overwhelming, take a deep breathe and start at the periphery. Move to the center from the periphery. Divide the big task into smaller sub-tasks. And then focus on each smaller sub-task one at a time.
his bow was an extension of his body, and his body an extension of his mind. He was in perfect alignment. He had no doubts and no distractions hindering his attention and intention to reach his aim. Nothing else existed: such was the intensity of his focus.

Sense of direction: untill and unless i am not aspired to do something from within focus and concentration will not happen. Arjuna was clear in his mind that he wanted to become the best archer in the world hence the focus and concentration. If inspired from with in there needs no one to come and tell me to do something. i go do things .. need to have that drive from with in. Desire is the most constructive power

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common format for text files in computers and on the Internet. In an ASCII file, each alphabetic, numeric, or special character is represented with a 7-bit binary number (a string of seven 0s or 1s). 128 possible characters are defined.

Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation

In mathematical numeral systems, the radix or base is the number of unique digits, including zero, used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. For example, for the decimal system (the most common system in use today) the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9.
For example, (100)10 (in the decimal system) represents the number one hundred, while (100)2 (in the binary system with base 2) represents the number four

A binary-to-text encoding is encoding of data in plain text. More precisely, it is an encoding of binary data in a sequence of printable characters

Computing
an independently operating Internet program, typically one that performs background tasks such as information retrieval or processing on behalf of a user or other program.

In computing, a user agent is software (a software agent) that is acting on behalf of a user. One common use of the term refers to a web browser telling a web site information about the browser and operating system. ... 

a user agent acts as a client in a network protocol used in communications within a client–server distributed computing system. In particular, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) identifies the client software originating the request, using a user-agent header, even when the client is not operated by a user.

When a software agent operates in a network protocol, it often identifies itself, its application type, operating system, software vendor, or software revision, by submitting a characteristic identification string to its operating peer

In HTTP, the User-Agent string is often used for content negotiation, where the origin server selects suitable content or operating parameters for the response. For example, the User-Agent string might be used by a web server to choose variants based on the known capabilities of a particular version of client software. The concept of content tailoring is built into the HTTP standard in RFC 1945 "for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations.”
