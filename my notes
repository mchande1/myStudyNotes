Version Control System (VCS) is a software that helps software developers to work together and maintain a complete history of their work

Following are the goals of a Version Control System.

Allow developers to work simultaneously.
Do not overwrite each other’s changes.
Maintain history of every version of everything.

Subversion falls under centralized version control system, meaning that it uses central server to store all files and enables team collaboration.

trunk: the main woody stem of a tree as distinct from its branches and roots

Commit is an atomic operation. Either the whole commit succeeds or is rolled back. Users never see half finished commit.

Atomic operation: Either they succeed or they fail

Subversion is a popular open-source version control tool

synchronize: cause to occur or operate at the same time or rate.
"soldiers used watches to synchronize movements"
their breathing slowly synchronized

artefact: an object made by a human being, typically one of cultural or historical interest.
"gold and silver artefacts"
Deployment Artifacts

An independent software vendor (ISV) is an organization specializing in making and selling software, designed for mass or niche markets. This is in contrast to software developed for in-house use only within an organization or software designed or adapted for a single, specific customer

niche: comfortable or suitable position
he has found his niche in life
syno: ideal position

unmanaged Package: A collection of application components that can be distributed and installed in other orgs.

Managed Package: A collection of application components with a namespace that can be distributed and installed in other orgs. Managed packages can be listed on the AppExchange and are upgradeable.

Manifest: clear or obvious to the eye or mind.
her manifest charm and proven ability
his manifest lack of interest in the proceedings
syno: obvious and clear

A deployment profile consists of a zip file containing metadata components and a package.xml file. The package.xml file is a manifest that lists everything being sent from the source org to the destination org

For example, if you’re using the Force.com IDE, the package.xml is assembled from the components you select when you create a project

The exception is if you use the Force.com Migration Tool or Workbench. In this case, you create package.xml files for retrieval (the files you bring to a local file system) and deployment (the files you send back to the server). It’s often easier to create a project in the Force.com IDE and then copy package.xml and use the copy for the Force.com Migration Tool.

When using change sets, you don’t see the package.xml file. It all happens behind the scenes. When you deploy change sets, the zip file of components and the manifest are handled seamlessly behind the scenes

The Force.com Migration Tool uses a project manifest, a file that’s named package.xml. The manifest is an XML file that defines the components you’re migrating and specifies the version of the Metadata API to use

Manifest: a document listing a ship's contents, cargo, passengers, and crew, for the use of customs officers

Take a look at the following package.xml file. The <name> specifies a metadata type, in this case, CustomObject. The <members> is a list of one or more components of that type. In this case, it lists two custom objects, Invoice__c and Line_Item__c

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Package xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
    <types>
        <members>Invoice__c</members>
        <members>Line_Item__c</members>
        <name>CustomObject</name>
    </types>
    <version>38.0</version>
</Package>

retrive: get or bring (something) back from somewhere
I was sent to retrive the balls from the garden

To retrieve all members of a type, you use the wildcard (*) character instead.

    <types>
        <members>*</members>
        <name>CustomObject</name>
    </types>


** Migrating Metadata Components

Migrating files between environments requires first copying metadata from one org to a local file system. You then transfer the metadata from the local files to another org. Several factors determine how long this operation can take.

You might be wondering why you need to store files to a local system to migrate files that are stored in the cloud. The Metadata API supports traditional software development tools that operate on source files, such as text editors, diff/merge utilities, and version control systems, all of which require a local file system. After you retrieve the metadata components locally, you can deploy them directly to any other org, including production. You don’t need to retrieve the components again for each deployment, unless when you want to get a fresh copy of the metadata.

You can monitor deployments that are in progress, check which deployments are waiting for execution, and view the results of completed deployments on the Deployment Status page. This page lists all deployments—change sets, Metadata API-based deployments, including deployments started from the Force.com IDE and the Force.com Migration Tool, and package installations.

In the deployment status we can we see how many components have been successfully deployed and how many have errored out

Once all the components are successfully deployed my test cases will start executing and can monitor the number of test cases passed vs number of test cases failed

You can initiate multiple deployments. Only one deployment can run at a time. The other deployments will remain in the queue waiting to be executed after the current deployment finishes

Administrators can’t delete components using change sets. As a result, they might resort to such tactics as deploying empty Apex classes to remove old functionality. This isn’t a particularly elegant solution, but it works well enough for admins that don’t have other means at their disposal.

To delete components, use the same procedure as for deploying components, but also include a delete manifest file named destructiveChanges.xml listing the components to delete. The file format is the same as package.xml, except that wildcards aren’t supported.


destructiveChangesPre.xml - to delete the components before adding any components
destructiveChangesPost.xml - to delete components after adding some components

When you deploy customizations with Apex code to production, local Apex tests are run as part of the deployment. Local Apex tests consist of all tests in the target org that don’t originate from managed packages. Testing in deployments helps ensure that the deployed components don’t alter or break existing customizations in production. Testing lets you catch and fix issues before the customizations are rolled out to production

Quick deployments cut down on deployment time by running tests as part of validations. Test levels give you the power to decide how many tests to run in the target org.

Roll out your customizations to production faster by running tests as part of validations and skipping tests in your deployments. Because quick deployments don’t run tests, they’re faster than regular deployments

we recommend that you first run a validation in production to verify the results of your tests and fix test failures. A validation is a deployment that’s used only to check the results of deploying components. It doesn’t save any components in the org. You can view the success and failure messages that you would receive with an actual deployment. After you fix test failures, and all tests pass as part of the validation, you can run a quick deployment, which skips tests and saves time.

To perform a quick deployment, first run a validation (a check-only deployment) with Apex test execution on the set of components to deploy. If your validation succeeds and qualifies for a quick deployment, you can start a quick deployment.

In traditional software development you have a code stack that represents the “source of truth”. This source resides in a version control system, and is iteratively developed and succeeded by new versions, or rolled back to previous versions

Sometimes new features are branched, meaning one code line forks off for more isolation from the main code line, and then oftentimes the branches are merged back into to the main line when that feature is ready

In cloud computing, the source of truth is what’s on the production org

version control repository only copies the code and metadata types that are exposed in the Metadata API. This means you can create things in a development environment (sandbox, developer org) that can’t be stored in source control

regulatory: serving or intended to regulate something.
"the existing legal and regulatory framework"

A source control system ensures a quality development process by maintaining a separate branch for each project without overwriting changes made as part of other projects

Team members and developers on other teams can add changes to the source control repository. The repository integrates the changes implemented by concurrent development and separates the different versions of an application.

Partial Copy
Partial Data sandboxes include all of your organization’s metadata and add a selected amount of your production organization's data that you define using a sandbox template

Developer Sandbox
REFRESH LIMIT    :-  Daily
DATA LIMIT          :-  200MB

Developer Pro Sandbox
REFRESH LIMIT    :-  Daily
DATA LIMIT          :-  1GB

DATA LIMIT          :-  5GB

Full Sandbox
REFRESH LIMIT    :-  29 Days
DATA LIMIT          :-  Same as Production

Continuous Integration System

For a robust quality assurance process, use a continuous integration system to run test deployments and Apex tests for each change to the source control repository. You can perform these deployments in a dedicated sandbox for continuous integrations.

Non-configuration changes, such as creating views, reports, and dashboards, can be made safely in production

Application lifecycle management is the process of managing an app’s development, from design to final release, and establishing a framework for managing changes

In Salesforce, development and test environments are represented by sandboxes. A sandbox is essentially a clone of your production org—its features, functionality, user licenses, and setup configuration. Sandboxes are usually used for development, testing, training, and merging changes from other sandboxes.

depricate: express disapproval of.
"what I deprecate is persistent indulgence"
Standard methods for deprecating classes and fields

When you have multiple developers in multiple sandboxes, you need to merge changes between the sandboxes before you deploy, which requires an integration sandbox

The source control system hosts the metadata (which includes source code) of projects in development in separate branches. When the app is deployed to production, it’s deployed from the source control system

Use a source control repository, such as git, for team development. Using an external source control repository enables merging changes from multiple developers. Also, the repository allows isolation of projects that are in development. The source control repository is the source for all customizations deployed to all other environments. After the changes have been tested and validated in the various environments, a test deployment is made to the staging environment. If the deployment succeeds, the changes are migrated to production

Full sandboxes are required only for performance and scalability testing, as well as for staging before final deployment

Creating or refreshing a sandbox doesn’t happen via the Metadata API, so the components copied aren’t restricted to objects that have XML representations. Therefore, you get a true and complete copy of everything in the production org.

Sandbox templates are available only in a Partial Copy or Full sandbox

If you have a Partial Copy or Full sandbox, you can pick which standard and custom objects to copy over from production by using sandbox templates. Sandbox templates help you limit the size of your sandbox by limiting the data that is copied over


A sandbox preview window occurs right before the upgrade so that you can try out new features before your production organization is upgraded. For a brief time, your sandbox and production organizations could be running different versions of Salesforce.

The Archive Options page allows you to save a snapshot of the project and the destination organization, respectively, before any changes are made. If you are deploying to a production organization, archive your destination organization to facilitate recovery, in the unlikely event that this is needed. The archive options save a snapshot of the project and the destination organization, respectively, before any changes are made. This facilitates recovery if needed. For deployments to production organizations, you should select both archive options.

A report is a list of records that meet the criteria you define. It’s displayed in Salesforce in rows and columns, and can be filtered, grouped, or displayed in a graphical chart.

Every report is stored in a folder. Folders can be public, hidden, or shared, and can be set to read-only or read/write. You control who has access to the contents of the folder based on roles, permissions, public groups, and license types. You can make a folder available to your entire organization, or make it private so that only the owner has access

A dashboard is a visual display of key metrics and trends for records in your org. The relationship between a dashboard component and report is 1:1; for each dashboard component, there is a single underlying report. 

Multiple dashboard components can be shown together on a single dashboard page layout, creating a powerful visual display and a way to consume multiple reports that often have a common theme, like sales performance, customer support, etc.

Each dashboard has a running user, whose security settings determine which data to display in a dashboard. If the running user is a specific user, all dashboard viewers see data based on the security settings of that user—regardless of their own personal security settings. For this reason, you’ll want to choose the running user wisely, so as not to open up too much visibility. For example, set the Sales Manager as the running user for a leaderboard for her team. This allows her team members to view the leaderboard for their individual team, but not other teams.

Dynamic dashboards are dashboards for which the running user is always the logged-in user. This way, each user sees the dashboard according to his or her own access level. If you’re concerned about too much access, dynamic dashboards might be the way to go.

A report type is like a template which makes reporting easier. The report type determines which fields and records are available for use when creating a report

Custom labels are custom text values that can be accessed from Apex classes, Visualforce pages, or Lightning components. The values can be translated into any language Salesforce supports. Custom labels enable developers to create multilingual applications by automatically presenting information (for example, help text or error messages) in a user's native language.

Whenever your web browser fetches a file (a page, a picture, etc) from a web server, it does so using HTTP - that's "Hypertext Transfer Protocol". HTTP is a request/response protocol, which means your computer sends a request for some file

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.

Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

GET - Requests data from a specified resource
POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

The Lightning Component framework is a UI framework for developing dynamic web apps for mobile and desktop devices. It’s a modern framework for building single-page applications engineered for growth.

The framework supports partitioned multi-tier component development that bridges the client and server. It uses JavaScript on the client side and Apex on the server side

Lightning components available in the Lightning App Builder so administrators can build custom user interfaces without code

Uses a stateful client and stateless server architecture that relies on JavaScript on the client side to manage UI component metadata and application data. The client calls the server only when absolutely necessary; for example to get more metadata or data. The server only sends data that is needed by the user to maximize efficiency. The framework uses JSON to exchange data between the server and the client. It intelligently utilizes your server, browser, devices, and network so you can focus on the logic and interactions of your apps.

Components are the self-contained and reusable units of an app. They represent a reusable section of the UI, and can range in granularity from a single line of text to an entire app.

A component registers that it may fire an event in its markup. Events are fired from JavaScript controller actions that are typically triggered by a user interacting with the user interface.

Event-driven programming is used in many languages and frameworks, such as JavaScript and Java Swing. The idea is that you write handlers that respond to interface events as they occur.

Component events are handled by the component itself or a component that instantiates or contains the component.
Application events are handled by all components that are listening to the event. These events are essentially a traditional publish-subscribe model.

Salesforce requires My Domain as a security measure to help prevent malicious attacks—just in case a security hole lies hidden deep within a third-party or custom component.

Domain Name: Example google.com, yahoo.com

@AuraEnabled enables client- and server-side access to the controller method.

regression: a return to a former or less developed state.

Single action
Test to verify that a single record produces the correct, expected result.
Bulk actions
Any Apex code, whether a trigger, a class or an extension, may be invoked for 1 to 200 records. You must test not only the single record case, but the bulk cases as well.

Conditional (ternary) Operator
Example: "The fee is " + (isMember ? "$2.00" : "$10.00")

binary: two
ternary: three - composed of three parts.

If the you deselect Community User Visibility, external users can’t see each other. The setting applies to all communities in your organization

Share groups allow you to share records owned by high-volume community users with internal and external users in your communities

High volume customer users/community users cannot be added in public groups. What they can do is they can share the records that they own with the salesforce users.

An interface is like a class in which none of the methods have been implemented—the method signatures are there, but the body of each method is empty. To use an interface, another class must implement it by providing a body for all of the methods contained in the interface

Once you create a constructor for a class, you no longer have access to the default, no-argument public constructor. You must create your own.

In Apex, a constructor can be overloaded, that is, there can be more than one constructor for a class, each having different parameters

By default, a method or variable is visible only to the Apex code within the defining class. You must explicitly specify a method or variable as public in order for it to be available to other classes in the same application namespace

Private: method or variable is accessible only within the Apex class in which it is defined

You can use static methods and variables only with outer classes. Inner classes have no static methods or variables. A static method or variable doesn’t require an instance of the class in order to run

A static method is used as a utility method, and it never depends on the value of an instance member variable. Because a static method is only associated with a class, it can’t access the instance member variable values of its class.

A static variable is static only within the scope of the Apex transaction. The value of a static variable persists within the context of a single transaction and is reset across transaction boundaries

To store information that is shared across instances of a class, use a static variable. All instances of the same class share a single copy of the static variable 

A class static variable can’t be accessed through an instance of that class

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position:absolute, position:relative, or position:fixed).

The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
The <div> tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.

Sample: 
<div style="color:#0000FF">
  <h3>This is a heading in a div element</h3>
  <p>This is some text in a div element.</p>
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>

A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Examples of block-level elements:
<div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>

The <span> tag is used to group inline-elements in a document.
The <span> tag provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document.
Sample:
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue">blue</span> eyes.</p>

uses of div and span tag
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements. the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content
<div>:	Defines a section in a document (block-level)
The <span> element is often used as a container for some text. the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text
<span>:	Defines a section in a document (inline)
